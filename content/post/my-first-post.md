What is machine learning? A question I’ve asked many and a question I was asked about, by many. No matter how many answers I’ve heard or how many answers I’ve given, I could never really understand the actual meaning.


**The phrase “Machine learning” was coined by Authur Samuel in 1952. He introduced this phrase in his paper as a “subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.”**

Do computers have the ability to learn? Can computers really learn? As an engineer, I always thought computers were dumb. And their output is continuously based on our input. It is true.


The truth is, machines don’t learn. According to Andriy Burkov, typically what machine learning does, is finding a mathematical formula and applying it to a collection of inputs(training data) which produce desired outputs.
This mathematical formula also generates correct outputs for other information(input data) on the condition that those inputs come from a similar statistical distribution as the training data initially used. So if the input data is slightly distorted, the output is very likely to change and produce inaccurate results(output) which is a contradiction to the term “learning”.


In simple terms, machine learning is an algorithm or combination of algorithms built based on statistical models to determine the pattern or forecast the future based on the past information (input data).
Types of Learning.

There are several machine learning algorithms and choosing the right algorithm or combination of algorithms to solve a problem is quite challenging. It is crucial to understand the four overarching categories of machine learning before examining specific algorithms.
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Semi-supervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
